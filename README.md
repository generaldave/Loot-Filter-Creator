Written using Python 3.4.3 and tkinter (for GUI).

To start the wizard, user clicks on the Start menu and chooses whether to including dynamic leveling or not.

Once the wizard is done user can goto Export in the File menu to export the file. It will be called loot.filter and stored in the folder where Loot Filter Creator was extracted to.

The name of the file can either be changed in file explorer after created or in Variables.py (FILTER_NAME) at the top.
